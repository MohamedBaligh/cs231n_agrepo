\section{Methods}

%Describe your learning algorithms, proposed algorithm(s), or theoretical proof(s). Make sure to include relevant mathematical notation. For example, say what the GAN objectives are or include your loss equation. It is okay to use formulas from the lecture notes. For each algorithm you use, give a brief description (2-3 sentences) of how it works. Again, we are looking for your understanding of how these deep learning algorithms work.
%Although the teaching staff probably know the algorithms, future readers may not (reports will be posted on the class website). Additionally, if you are using a niche or cutting-edge algorithm (e.g. WGAN, SURF features, or anything else not covered in the class), you may want to explain your algorithm using several paragraphs. Note: Theory/algorithms projects may have an appendix showing extended proofs (see appendix description below).


We plan to use Convolutional Neural Networks for an application based project.
